## 🚨 What is this?

This repo is my personal **"No-LLM Coding Challenge"**:  
Every day, I spend **1 hour coding without using any AI assistants**, Copilot, or autocomplete crutches.

The goal?  
Reclaim the **raw power of syntax flow**, problem solving, and muscle memory.  
Because LLMs are great — but I still want to be dangerous *without them*.

---

## Daily Flow

- Alternate days between **Python** and **JavaScript**
- Build **tiny tools**, **snappy scripts**, or **fun utilities**
- One hour max per day — timeboxed and focused
- All commits are raw: no AI help, no codegen

---

## What's Inside?

| Day | Language | Project | Link |
|-----|----------|---------|------|
| 1 | Python | [CLI Stopwatch](./python/cli-stopwatch/) | `argparse`, `time` module |
| 2 | JavaScript | *Coming soon...* | |

> Everything here is hand-written. No AI wheels, no training wheels.

## Why “code-without-wheels”?

Because:

- LLMs are **training wheels**. Useful, but easy to get addicted.
- I want to **remember how to think**, not just prompt.
- Coding isn’t just syntax — it’s a sport. And this is training.

---

## Goals

- Get faster at reading docs
- Improve debugging & logic writing
- Strengthen mental model of JS & Python
- Reinforce fundamentals (loops, closures, callbacks, classes, etc.)
